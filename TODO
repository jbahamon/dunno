TODO:


========================================================================
Physics
========================================================================

- Slopes

- Proper walking on ladders (making the top of a ladder a one-directional
  platform seems a way to do it)

========================================================================
Enemies and Stage Elements
========================================================================

- Better (re)spawning and despawning.

========================================================================
Characters
========================================================================

- Define a way to easily implement different formes for a character 
  without having to specify the full set of states all over again. A way 
  to do this could be to have different sprite sheets and switch between 
  them, and have a "currentForme" variable.

========================================================================
Elements (stage elements AND characters)
========================================================================

- change the way transitions are specified. maybe a section dedicated to
  transitions in a player/element's definition.
- Add "drawPriority"

========================================================================
Stages
========================================================================

- Add parameters to the room transition modes (scrolling speed/time, etc)
- Add "drawPriority" parameters to layers, enabling foreground elements.
- Parallax?

========================================================================
Managers (World, Camera)
========================================================================

- move elements to the world/camera manager
- add references to players and elements to the camera manager, or get
  them passed to it by the worldmanager
- fix bugs with the scrolling camera (try entering tourian's second room
  while jumping/walking) Might have something to do with the camera's 
  getVisible(). Actually, we should play Metroid and see how the camera 
  works in-game.
========================================================================
Other (documentation, global stuff, etc)
========================================================================

- list public table values for each class (e.g. element.collisionFlags, 
element.dynamics, etc)

- add ldoc comments to some functions that are missing them

- write up a readme.md
