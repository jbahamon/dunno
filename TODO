TODO:

- Slopes
- Better (re)spawning and despawning.

- Define a way to easily implement different formes for a character without having to specify the full set of states all
	over again. A way could be to have different sprite sheets and switch between them, and have a "currentForme" variable.

- change the way transitions are specified. maybe a section dedicated to transitions in a player/element's definition.

- Add parameters to the room transition modes (scrolling speed/time, etc)

- change "ground" layer to "background"; add optional "foreground" layer

- list public table values for each class (e.g. element.collisionFlags, element.dynamics, etc)

- move elements to the world/camera manager

- add references to players and elements to the camera manager, or get them passed to it by the worldmanager

- fix bugs with the scrolling camera (try entering tourian's second room while jumping/walking) Might have something to do with the camera's getVisible(). Actually, we should play Metroid and see how the camera works.

- find a good way to have the top tile of a ladder as a platform. 

- add ldoc comments to some functions that are missing them

- write up a readme.md
